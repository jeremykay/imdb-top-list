imdb-top-list
=============

This is a very simple php app built with codeigniter that scans the IMDB top 250 movies list and stores the top ten in a database.

I did as an exercise a few months back and thought I'd add it here as an example of some work I've done.

Some of the features include
----------------------------

* Parses the DOM of imdb.com and stores the top 10 movies in a local db
* Client-side and server-side validation of the search field
* Caches main pages for faster page loading
* Built in codeigniter
